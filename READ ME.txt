IMPORTANT DETAILS:
1) Please note that I do not own the game and therefore when a  problem arrives, I will not be the one which will solve the problem.
2) Note that this is only for educational purposes. NO INTENTION of spreading the game. 
3) Feel free to leave a comment in the video if you find a problem I would try my very best to answer them all. 
4) Note that the game may be glitched out in my recording of the video due to my screen recorder
(Hopefully it will not happen again.)

I hope you guys enjoy this game. From the positive response from my tutorial videos, it have been a pleasure to teach you how to download this.
